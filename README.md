# NVIDIA RTX HERO 
 Nvidai RTX 3090 Add to cart bot.
 
 Currently putting together multiple tools I have been using to score an RTX 3090. 
 
 This version will check if a model is in stock, and will add it to the cart. I do have several bots that will go through the checkout process but they work with limited success due to anti-bot tactics employed on nearly every website selling the 3090. 
 
 Future updates to the public version of this tool:
 
 1. Checkout attempt if captcha doesn't appear
 2. Add the Nvidia store (api has been unreliable lately so it isn't included in this version)
 3. Add 3080 and 3070 models
 4. Provide user with parameters to set for the search
 5. "Sneakerbot" residencial proxy setup
