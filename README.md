 ## OCT 9th Updates:
 
 #### Looking for a GUI designer to hop onboard this project
 #### Checkout reddit.com/r/GPUBOTS  for GPU Bot discussions
 
 
 NVIDIA RTX 3090 add to cart bot.
 
Find 3090 and 3080 cards in stock at Newegg, Bestbuy or Amazon

Use this behind a proxy or VPN. 

This tool will find an in stock gpu, and send your phone an add to cart link for bestbuy, or a product link on newegg that will have apple pay. This should speed up the checkout process quite a bit. 

Features to integrate:
1. Autocheckout (I had this working prior to the 3080 launch. After the 3080 launch bot detection has increased quiet a bit. It is very hard to not be seen as a bot so I may not fully integrate this feature again. I honestly believe it is faster to just checkout with saved information in your browser to avoid avoid bot detection. 




I am open to suggestions! Please let me know of any features you think would help you get a 3090/3080!
